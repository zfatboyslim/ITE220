I was going to use the scrollTo function at first from github
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.scrollto/2.1.2/jquery.scrollTo.min.js"></script>

But then I realised that jquery has it's own function "scrollTop" Which I used instead because I find it to be easier and
does not rely on external plugins.

The rest of the homework criteria should be completed.

I made it so that if you click Contact Us on the top right of the page, it will scroll down to the bottom where the contact box is.
